## Course Overview

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+. It is based on standard Python type hints. The course aims to teach you how to create APIs efficiently and effectively. By the end of this course, you'll have the knowledge to build and deploy your applications.

### What You Will Learn

- How to set up FastAPI and create your first API.
- Work with path parameters and query parameters.
- Understand request and response models using Pydantic.
- Implement authentication and authorization.
- Handle database operations with SQLAlchemy.
- Create and manage Docker containers for your applications.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashok14k/FastAPI-The-Complete-Course-2025-Beginner-Advanced-Udemy.git
```

Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd FastAPI-The-Complete-Course-2025-Beginner-Advanced-Udemy
```

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed. You can check your Python version with:

```bash
python --version
```

Next, install the required packages. It is best to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the FastAPI application with the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Folder Structure

The repository follows a structured approach to make navigation easier. Below is an overview of the main folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routers/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schemas/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- `app/main.py`: The main application file where the FastAPI app instance is created.
- `app/models/`: Contains database models.
- `app/routers/`: Houses the API route definitions.
- `app/schemas/`: Holds Pydantic models for request and response validation.
- `app/utils/`: Any utility functions.

## Code Examples

Here are some snippets to illustrate common tasks:

### Basic GET Request

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

### Creating a User Model

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
```

### Authentication Example

```python
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

@app.post("/token")
async def login(form: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):
    # Perform authentication
    pass
```
